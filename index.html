<h1 style="color:white; text-align: center; font-size: 70px;">Redesigning Disney+</h1>
<p style = "text-align:center;"><img src="https://cell-only.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/disney_plus_logo_1820.0-1080x675.jpg" alt = "Disney+" width="300" height="175"></p>
<h2 style="color:white; font-size: 35px; text-align: center;">Design Focus and Problem Space</h2>
<p style="color:white; font-size: 20px;"> For this project, I wanted to focus on redesigning Disney+. Disney+ is a streaming platform created by the Walt Disney Company that allows users to stream a variety of Disney content from movies to television shows. The platform is fairly new, especially compared to other streaming websites, so I wanted to see if I could improve certain aspects of the experience.</p>
<h3 style="color:white; font-size: 25px; text-align: center;">Users</h3>
<p style="color:white; font-size: 20px;"> Disney+ is used by a variety of different people. The platform is targeted to both children and adults, with a large focus on families. According to The Observer, "as many as 50 percent of U.S. internet users with children under 10 in their households have already subscribed to the Disney+ streaming service". </p>
<h3 style="color:white; font-size: 25px; text-align: center;">Key Problems</h3>
<p style="color:white; font-size: 20px;"> Disney+ is a fairly new steaming platform, launching in late 2019. Therefore, it is expected that there are a number of different problems with the user interface and experience.
    Seeing as Disney+ is targeted mostly to families with both adults and young children, it follows that the website should be easy to navigate and intuitive. As a Disney+ user myself, I have noticed a few problems with the platform.
    Firstly, the content that the user has already been viewing, found under the header "Continue Watching" is not found at the very top of the home page. Next, when using the horizontal scroll to browse content, the lists do not loop over,
    causing the user to have to scroll all the way back to return to the beginning of the list. Furthermore, there is a list of five different collections on the home page, but the rest of the collections are found on the search page.
    Finally, the content under the "Originals" tab is completely unorganized and has no filtering mechanism.  </p>
<h2 style="color:white; font-size: 35px; text-align: center;">Contextual Inquiry</h2>
<p style="color:white; font-size: 20px;"> For contextual inquiry, I recruited another senior undergraduate student. This student is not subscribed to Disney+ and has never personally used or navigated the platform.
    I asked this user to complete a series of three tasks to assess how user friendly the Disney+ interface is, and to see if the problems I had previously mentioned actually negatively impact the user experience.  </p>
<h3 style="color:white; font-size: 25px; text-align: center;">Task 1: Finding Recently Watched Content</h3>
<p style="color:white; font-size: 20px;"> For the first task, I wanted the user to locate the recently watched content, which is usually found under a header called "Continue Watching".
    The user arrived at the Disney+ landing page and expected to see the "Continue Watching" header at the top of the page. Instead, the
    first thing the user saw was a large, scrolling rectangle advertising new content. Directly, underneath that the user found five buttons which represented
    different collections that the user could navigate to. Underneath that the user found content under the header "Recommended for You". The user then
    had to scroll down to see content under the header "New To Disney+". Finally, the user had to scroll down a little more to finally see the content under
    "Continue Watching". The user expected to see the "Continue Watching" content immediately, but instead had to scroll down on the landing page past four different features before finally locating what they were looking for.   </p>
<h3 style="color:white; font-size: 25px; text-align: center;">Task 2: Locating the Disney Nature Collection</h3>
<p style="color:white; font-size: 20px;"> Next, I asked the user to locate the Disney Nature Collection. On the landing page, the user saw that there were five different collections listed, but the Disney Nature Collection
    was not one of them. This confused the user, who then decided to use the search page to locate the collection. When typing "Disney Nature Collection" into the search bar, the user was presented with an error message saying that there were no results found,
    but not the Disney Nature Collection itself. The user then returned to the landing page and scrolled all the way down in an attempt to locate the collection, but was unable to find it. The user then returned to the search page and
    noticed that there were several different collection listed on that page directly under the search bar. The user then scrolled down that page until they were finally able to locate the Disney Nature Collection all the way at the bottom of the
    page. Seeing the five collections on the home page made the user assume that the other collections would be listed there as well. Furthermore, the user did not expect that the rest of the collections would be found on the search page under the search bar.   </p>
<h3 style="color:white; font-size: 25px; text-align: center;">Task 3: Browse the Disney+ Original Musicals</h3>
<p style="color:white; font-size: 20px;"> Finally, I asked to user to browse through the Disney+ Original Musicals. Seeing the "Originals" tab at the top of the screen, the user navigated there. The user was then presented with a long list of Disney+ original content, but did not immediately see
    any musicals. The user then began to scroll down the page, scrolling past several categories which included "Featured", "Action and Adventure", and "Comedy". Seeing this, the user assumed that the list of categories was in alphabetical order but quickly realized that this
    was not the case. The user had to scroll all the way down the page to finally find the "Musicals" category. </p>
